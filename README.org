* Routine for solving the TOV equations

Solves the TOV equations expressed as function of the pseudo enthalpy with routines from scipy.integrate.
The code is written for tabulated EOSs in the Pizza format for the [[https://bitbucket.org/FreeTHC/dist][WhiskyTHC]] code in [[https://www.einsteintoolkit.org/][Einstein Toolkit]] but can probably be easily adapted for other formats.
